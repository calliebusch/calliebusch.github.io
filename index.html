                <p>
                    I'm a data enthusiast with experience building impactful products in the eCommerce, emerging transportation, and real estate spaces. 
                    My academic background is in statistics, so I’m currently focused on expanding my knowledge of software engineering best practices.

                <p>
                    My first Data Analytics Internship at a grocery eCommerce startup laid the foundation for me to pursue a career in data. At Rosie, I learned SQL, built an OLAP cube, and created dashboards that gave store managers a deep understanding of their customer base. In true startup style, I also jumped in on mini projects with the Quality Assurance and Marketing teams.

                <br>
                <p>Interning on the Data Science Team at Uber’s autonomous vehicle research unit exposed me to cutting-edge sampling and modeling techniques. Throughout the summer, I developed and deployed a dynamic data visualization web app in Python and built classification models to predict road scenarios.</p>

                    <br>
                  <p>I graduated from Cornell with a degree in Statistics and a minor in Science & Technology Studies. In my classes, I learned the math and theory behind statistical models, and how to evaluate their social implications before implementation. I also conducted research through Cornell University Sustainable Design, worked as a teaching assistant, and co-instructed Intro to Rock Climbing through Cornell Outdoor Education. </p>

                    <p>While on the Data Team at Tishman Speyer,  I built products that helped leadership make strategic real estate investment decisions and streamlined property management strategies. During my tenure, I wrote web scrapers to compile custom datasets, developed an access control monitoring dashboard, implemented a clustering algorithm to group similar lease signatories based on fuzzy matching criteria, and built dynamic geospatial data visualizations which allowed analysts to search target cities based on demographic and property characteristics.  </p>
