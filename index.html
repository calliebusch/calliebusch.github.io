                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm a New-York-City-based data analyst with experiance building impactful products in the eCommerce, emerging transportation, and real estate spaces. 
                    Right now, I'm interested in transportation and urban development, but one of the things I love about data science is its never-ending list of applications.
                    My academic background is in statistics, so I'm currently focused on expanding my knowlege of software engineering best practices. 
                    Feel free to check out my projects section and let me know if you see something that can be optimized.

                <p>
                    My first Data Analytics Internship at a grocery eCommerce startup laid the foundation for me to pursue a career in data science. At Rosie, I learned SQL, built an OLAP cube, and created dashboards that gave store managers a deep understanding of their customer base. In true startup style, I also jumped in on mini projects with the Quality Assurance and Marketing teams.

                <p>Interning on the Data Science Team at Uber’s autonomous vehicle research unit exposed me to cutting-edge sampling and modeling techniques. Throughout the summer, I developed and deployed a dynamic data visualization web app in Python and built classification models to predict road scenarios.</p>

                  <p>I graduated from Cornell with a degree in Statistics and minor in Science & Technology Studies. In my classes, I learned the math and theory behind statistical models, and how to evaluate their social implications before implementation. I also conducted research through Cornell University Sustainable Design, worked as a teaching assistant, and co-instructed Intro to Rock Climbing through Cornell Outdoor Education. </p>
